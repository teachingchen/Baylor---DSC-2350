## Course Description:
An introduction to the foundations of discrete structures as they apply to data science, focusing on providing a solid theoretical foundation for further work. Topics include sets, ordered structures, graph and trees, functions, proof techniques, number systems, logic, Boolean algebra, etc.

## Prerequisites:
C or better in CSI 1402 or concurrent enrollment; MTH 1321 or concurrent enrollment.

## Requirements and Grading: 
This course is A-E graded, and the grades are determined based on graded assignments:\
* Exams: 40% 
* Homework Assignments: 40%
* Quizzes: 15% 
* Attendance: 5% 
* Bonus: 10% (Extra on top of the final grade)

Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:

| A      | A-    | B+    | B     | B-    | C+    | C     | C-    | D+    | D     | D-    | E    |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 100-95 | 94-90 | 89-87 | 86-83 | 82-80 | 79-77 | 76-73 | 72-70 | 69-67 | 66-63 | 62-60 | 59-0 |

## Missed Exams, Homeworks, and Quizzes:
No makeup exams and quizzes will be given. Homeworks are due by midnight of the due date and are submitted on Canvas. Assignments are graded on a scale of 0 â€“ 100, with a 10 points deduction per day late. Homeworks are not accepted and graded zero more than three days late.
